This project is for **educational and personal use only**. It uses a self-hosted instance of the [MangaHook API](https://github.com/kiraaziz/mangahook-api), which scrapes manga data from publicly available third-party websites.

Some metadata and content (e.g., manga titles, descriptions, chapter lists, and images) may be cached in a private PostgreSQL database for performance and offline access.
